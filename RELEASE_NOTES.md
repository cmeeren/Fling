Release notes
==============

These are the release notes for Fling (the main package).
See [RELEASE_NOTES_Fling.Interop.Facil.md](RELEASE_NOTES_Fling.Interop.Facil.md) for the release notes for
Fling.Interop.Facil.

### 0.7.0 (2025-01-16)

Parts of the API have been redesigned with several breaking changes. This was necessary because the transaction
functionality was in some ways fundamentally broken, and did not play well with connection pooling. Fling does not use
`TransactionScope` anymore, and therefore no longer manages transactions. To use transactions, thread the
connections/transactions through the loader as the `'arg` parameter. You can still run loaders serially or in parallel
(remember to keep running them serially if your connections/transactions require that).

Changes compared to 0.5.1:

* **Breaking:** Replaced `loadParallelWithoutTransaction`, `loadBatchParallelWithoutTransaction`,
  `loadSerialWithTransaction`, and `loadBatchSerialWithTransaction` with
  `loadParallel`, `loadBatchParallel`, `loadSerial`, and `loadBatchSerial`. All four functions no longer take as a
  parameter the root DTO directly, but instead a function that accepts `'arg` and returns the root DTO(s)
  asynchronously. This allows loading the root in the same transaction as the children.
* None of the new functions use `TransactionScope`. Instead, use explicit connections/transactions and thread them
  through the loader using `'arg`.

### ~~0.6.0 (2025-01-13)~~

**Unlisted, see changelog above instead.**

* ~~**Breaking:** Now supports loading the root in the same transaction as the children. To achieve this,
  `loadSerialWithTransaction` and `loadBatchSerialWithTransaction` now accept `Async`-wrapped root DTOs, and load these
  in the same transaction as the children. The previous functions can be accessed under the new names
  `loadChildrenSerialWithTransaction` and `loadChildrenBatchSerialWithTransaction`.~~
* ~~**Possibly breaking:** `loadSerialWithTransaction` and `loadBatchSerialWithTransaction` now use
  `TransactionScopeOption.Required` instead of
  `TransactionScopeOption.RequiresNew` to avoid locking issues. This is also likely to be more correct in the contexts
  in which Fling is used.~~
* ~~Added `loadSerialWithSnapshotTransaction` and `loadBatchSerialWithSnapshotTransaction` which are identical to their
  non-`Snapshot` counterparts but use `TransactionIsolationLevel.Snapshot`.~~

### 0.5.1 (2024-11-07)

* Fixed bug introduced in 0.5.0 where `...WithoutUpdate` functions would throw even if there was nothing to update

### 0.5.0 (2024-11-06)

* **Breaking** (hopefully not in practice): For to-many child entities, all deletes are performed first, then all
  updates, then all inserts. The previous behavior was deletes first, then each new child (in the order returned by your
  code) was either inserted or updated.
* Added `batchSaveChildren*` functions for batching inserts/updates/deletes of to-many children

### 0.4.0 (2022-10-25)

* **Breaking:** `runLoader` is renamed to `loadParallelWithoutTransaction`
* **Breaking:** `runBatchLoader` is renamed to `loadBatchParallelWithoutTransaction`
* Added `loadSerialWithTransaction`
* Added `loadBatchSerialWithTransaction`

### 0.3.0 (2021-10-29)

* Target .NET 6

### 0.2.2 (2021-04-27)

* Added `...WithDifferentOldNew` variants of all child save functions that allows specifying a separate `toDto` function
  for the old and new entity. This can be useful for example if you are persisting computed state. You can load the
  existing persisted state from the DB together with your entity, and when persisting, you can compare the persisted
  state from the old entity with the new computed state based on the new entity.

### 0.2.1 (2021-03-17)

* Added `saveChildWithoutUpdate`, `saveOptChildWithoutUpdate`, and `saveChildrenWithoutUpdate` for child entities that
  donâ€™t support update (e.g. association tables, where the key is essentially the whole DTO).

### 0.2.0 (2021-03-17)

* Breaking: `saveRoot` now takes insert/update functions that return `Async<unit>`. For the old signature, use the new
  function `saveRootWithOutput`.

### 0.1.0 (2021-03-15)

* Initial release
